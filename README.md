Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical parameters using ML models# diabetes-ml-model
Diabetes is a chronic disease and early detection is important. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes based on features like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.
 DATASET

Dataset source (Kaggle, UCI, etc.)
Dataset contains 768 records with 8 medical attributes like Glucose, BloodPressure, BMI, Age, etc.
